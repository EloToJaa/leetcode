# You are given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
#
# You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
#
# You can return the answer in any order.
#
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
#
# Output: [0,1]
#
# Explanation:
#
# The sum of nums[0] and nums[1] is 2 + 7 = 9, which equals the target. Therefore, the indices [0, 1] are returned.
#
#
# Example 2:
#
# Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
#
# Output: [1,2]
#
# Explanation:
#
# The sum of nums[1] and nums[2] is 2 + 4 = 6, which equals the target. Therefore, the indices [1, 2] are returned.
#
#
# Example 3:
#
# Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
#
# Output: [0,1]
#
# Explanation:
#
# The sum of nums[0] and nums[1] is 3 + 3 = 6, which equals the target. Therefore, the indices [0, 1] are returned.
#
#
#
# Constraints:
#
#
# 	2 <= nums.length <= 10⁴
# 	-10⁹ <= nums[i] <= 10⁹
# 	-10⁹ <= target <= 10⁹
# 	Only one valid answer exists.
#
#
#
# Follow-up: Can you come up with an algorithm that is less than O(n²) time complexity?
